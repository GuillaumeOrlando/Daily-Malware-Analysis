Packed Formbook - Stage 1
MD5: ffa3fb48a339894ea095d4daf804011c
File: formbook_packed.exe

TL;DR: AES decryptor of an embeded ressource

Entropy at almost 8 for the .txt section: 99% sure that this is packed
Compiled with .NET, this is not the final payload
Original name: "cnxuoir.exe"

=========================================

We can see what's look like some Chinnese strings everywhere, and everything lightly is obfuscated.
Timestamps where reset to '01.01.1970'
Pseudo-deobfuscated file: 'formbook_packed_clean.exe' (cleaned by hand)

* method1
  Main function of the binary
  Load the content of some embeded ressources in memory (identify by Chineses strings)
  Perform an AES decryption on thoses ressources:
    AES key of 32 bytes ['0x2d', '0x43', '0x38', '0xac', '0xd7', '0x73', '0x16', '0xab', '0x9f', '0x85', '0xbc', '0xf2', '0xd4', '0x1d', '0x91', '0xd7', '0xb4', '0x15', '0xdb', '0x58', '0x2', '0xdf', '0x74', '0xce', '0xac', '0x4', '0x43', '0xa6', '0x27', '0x67', '0x32', '0xc3']
    IV of 16 bytes (233,190,216,250,107,215,161,64,130,36,233,18,117,168,216,65)    
    encrypted content of 288294 bytes (136,173,228,148,35,[...],76,211,234,41,193)
  Then it simply invoke the decrypted binary

* method2 
  Usage: takes a function name as a string and invoke it:
  i.e: it is called as: method2("System.Threading.Thread", null, "sleep", [2])
  Parameter1: not used
  Parameter2: return value handler
  Parameter3: function name
  Parameter4: array of arguments for the function

* method2 
  Returns the lenght of a given string

* method4
  Extract byte content from thoses weird strings with criptic meaning:
  "乆両丁乱且乐丷乇丹乬丆一乩临丶乸久乤乵丗买乳丫乥丝丫世乩" -> "You are in chaos and are happy"
  "乸丕丨乱乶乂丂乹乡乬乮丈乮世乂丼乛乀丝乴业串乴並乿乡乲乊丱丨乿乨" -> "Chaotic"
  "乞乡乳乣乖乭买主乪丬中丬丘乇丼为临乷乇中丩乘乾丕严丑丯両乒临乄乣丿不丶乞丱也" -> "Begging for the town’s ruins and obedient buyers"
  And a lot more ...
  It also retreive the IV and the key for the latter on EAS decryption

Decrypted payload saved as: 'decrypted.bin'
This is not the final payload, since it's looks like a ConfuserEx packed bianry.
