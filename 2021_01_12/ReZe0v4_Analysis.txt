Trojan / Dropper

Impersonate the "3uAirPlayer.exe" binary in it's description

Dot net + High Entropy

Function / Symbols are obfuscated -> de4dot deobfuscation.
Deobfuscated sample : 75ae099ac07ea1d262c005391c668da8

Still heaily Obfuscated

Initiate some strings before the Main() call
Load a PE in memory
Create new process of itself after a short sleep, in a SUSPENDED state
Inject a DLL in the suspended process with WriteProcessMemory (saved as inject1.bin)

Drop it and execute it as a Scheduled task:
	"C:\Windows\System32\schtasks.exe" /Create /TN "Updates\JyVNBfjFOm" /XML "C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpEE6F.tmp"

Extract1.exe (name PYNO) deobfuscated with de4dot once again -> Extract1-cleaned.exe
	Delete itself with a powershell command:
	"cmd" /c start /b powershell Start-Sleep -Seconds 2; Remove-Item -path 'C:\Users\user\AppData\Local\Temp\extract1.exe' & exit

Map an executable in memory (extract1.exe)
Seems to be a Keylogger
