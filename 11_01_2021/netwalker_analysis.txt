No strings, only one imported function (sleep)
Heavily obfuscated:
	API Hashing capabilities
	DLL hashing capabilities
	Strings obfuscation

Use the PEB to retrive Loaded DDL, hash it, then compare against the given hash
Not the same algorithm between the DLL hashing function and the API hashing function

Pseudo code:
	DLL = Resolve_DLL(hash_dll)
	winAPI = Resolve_API(DLL, api_hash)

Resolve each API at the beginning, DLL by DLL.
Store them in the heap, at a specific offset

DLL resolver script available under the name dll_resolve.dll
Script output:
	ntdll.dll 0x84c05e40
	kernel32.dll 0x6ae69f02
	advapi32.dll 0xf16ed7e0
	shell32.dll 0xc8a1bad8
	mpr.dll 0x7d42fe1c

Badly implemented: If the dll resolver function failed, the malware can fetch a hardcoded version of the dll string, which makes no sense at all:
	[...]
	v7 = func_Resolve_DLL(0x6AE69F02);
        if ( !v7 )
        	v7 = sub_4012A0(aKernel32Dll_0);
